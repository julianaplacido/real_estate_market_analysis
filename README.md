### House Pricing

In this project we'll try to apply different techniques (Data Transformation, Hyperparameter Optimization, Advanced Models, etc.) to create a model with a great behavior capable of predicting different house prices.


The project has three parts:

PART A - Data Transformation

-Imputation of missing values

-Detection and elimination of outliers

-Encoding

-Data Scaling

We'll create a benchmark with the transformed data.

PART B - Advanced models

PART C - Interpretation of the models

Try to answer different questions like:

-Which variables were relevant for the model?

-Which variables were not?

-Were is the model failing? Why?
